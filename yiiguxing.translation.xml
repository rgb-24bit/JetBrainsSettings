      <item value="PercentageOfNodesToScore is the percentage of all nodes that once found feasible for running a pod, the scheduler stops its search for more feasible nodes in the cluster. This helps improve scheduler's performance. Scheduler always tries to find at least &quot;minFeasibleNodesToFind&quot; feasible nodes no matter what the value of this flag is. Example: if the cluster size is 500 nodes and the value of this flag is 30, then scheduler stops finding further feasible nodes once it finds 150 feasible ones. When the value is 0, default percentage (5%--50% based on the size of the cluster) of the nodes will be scored." />
